# Johto Expansion Pak
This is a ROM Hack of Pokemon Crystal, playing upon the Kanto Expansion Pak's old philosophy. It adds Johto- and Kanto-related Pokemon to Crystal, more interesting locations, and QoL changes.

Being so much more elaborate than Kanto, with what is essentially an entirely different game in its development stages, the Johto Expansion Pak is a far more ambitious project than KEP. Most notably, there is a much-extended storyline.

If playing on an emulator, BGB is strongly recommended for its accuracy and features. Inaccurate emulators, such as VBA and TGB Dual, can experience unintended glitches. This hack is fully playable on official hardware as well.

# New Pokemon
Using the Kanto Expansion Pak's original criteria, the ethos of the Johto Expansion Pak will be to add every "Johto- and Kanto-related Pokemon to Crystal without fundamentally changing the way the game is played." 

What falls under "Johto- and Kanto-related" is a Pokemon is the following, so long as they are, in fact, related:
- Is a regional variant (Eg. Hisuian Sneasel)
- Evolves from or into a Pokemon (eg. Tangrowth, Honchkrow)
- Was cut from the final game (eg. Bellignan, Tricules, Phandarin; "beta" Pokemon) or cut from a future title while being related to a Kanto/Johto Pokemon (eg. Lizargun/Charmada)
- Is a regional convergent (eg. Wugtrio, Toedscruel; "Okagyaradosu" qualifies for this)
- Is a Paradox equivalent (eg. Walking Wake)
- Would qualify for the Kanto Expansion Pak (eg. Omegadge, Melmetal)

Any Pokemon that you can think of that would come under this, is absolutely in. Dex total is 483!

Many prototype Pokemon have very little information around them: You'll be hard-pressed to find stats, cries, movesets, anything for some. With the Kanto Expansion Pak, we used all context clues available to try and formulate a picture-perfect, accurate representation to the best of our abilities. We've done this with the May 1998 Sprite Cache Pokemon, among others. Whenever something confirmed exists, it is used, and that then informs the interpretation. We also take Nob Ogasawara names as canon whenever they appear.

Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, etc, are not in active consideration.

# Changes
- There is now an enby character option named Topaz, purple-themed.
- You can now name your mother, just as it was in Gold and Silver's prototype stages!
- There is a new Nihon region, based on the 1998 version before it got scrapped for Johto. 
- The Fairy-type is now available, using the  though Pokemon are not retroactively changed, per the Kanto Expansion Pak philosophy (you wouldn't want a Fairy-type Granbull pre-split, would you?)
- Additionally, Fairy uses the proto-XY discovery from the 2024 Teraleak, being closer to GSC. Thus...
	- Fairy attacks are Super Effective vs: Fighting, Bug, Dragon, Dark
	- Fairy attacks are Not Very Effective vs: Fire, Ice, Steel
	- Fairy-type Pokemon are weak to: Fire, Ice, Steel
	- Fairy-type Pokemon resist: Fighting, Bug, Dark
	- Fairy-type Pokemon are Immune To: Dragon
- Fossil revival is back in town! Get fossils using Rock Smash and revive them at Ruins of Alph or the newly-added Pewter Museum of Science!
- Breakable rocks now give useful items...
	- 1% MAX_REVIVE
	- 2% DOME_FOSSIL - Kabuto
	- 2% HELIX_FOSSIL - Omanyte
	- 2% WING_FOSSIL - Feradactyl
	- 2% OLD_AMBER - Decilla
	- 2% CLUB_FOSSIL - Xylodon
	- 4% STAR_PIECE
	- 10% BIG_PEARL
	- 18% ETHER
	- 24% HARD_STONE
	- 24% SOFT_SAND
	- 48% PEARL
	- 64% BRICK_PIECE
- Many new Trainer classes, including;
	- RBY classes not in GSC, such as the Rocker, Channeler, and even the beta Firefighter
	- Prototype GSC classes such as the Male Teacher, Sportsman, and Soldier
	- The Painter from FRLG!
	- The Elder from HGSS, featuring the NTSC Sage sprite.
	- Decensor is applied to the Fisher, Beauty, Female Swimmer, Medium, and Sage sprites, to match the Japanese version. Let Tully have a puff!
- Many evolution stones have been added to accomodate the Pokemon featured here, including the Heart and Poison Stones from the SpaceWorld demo, and the Peat Block!
- The Fairy Feather from Scarlet and Violet has been added to accomodate the Fairy type.
- The Antique Pot has been added to accomodate a Shuckle evolution!
- New Club and Wing Fossils; the former for Xylodon, a May98 Prototype Pokemon, and the latter for Feradactyl, (seemingly) an Aerodactyl pre-evolution from the same prototype.
- The unused Honey Pot from prototype GSC has been added! 2 days after placing Sweet Honey, you can encounter either Munchlax, Beedrill, Ursaring, or Heracross!
- Unused moves from the SpaceWorld demo have been re-implemented and distributed amongst the Pokemon. This includes the unused HMs, each with unique effects, sometimes calling back to other titles.

## Technical Changes
- Numerous important registers, such as map and Pokemon IDs, now support 16-bit IDs, allowing for significantly more additions to the game. This makes JEP possible.
	- Important to note is the fact Crystal has ~30% free ROM space, which, given the sheer amount of content inside, makes this bountiful. This, too, makes JEP possible. Regardless, expanded ROMs can be played from good flash cartridges, so ROM space is not a concern to the team.
- Tilesets now handle up to 255 titles (from 192), allowing for slightly nicer maps. We also have flipped tiles available for more complexity.
- Can now have up to 17 object events.
- Footprint pictures were optimised to make dex additions easier on memory. Before, they were mapped to a single bank - optimal for 8-bits, but not for 16!
- Lots of unnecessary, unreferenced code was removed as and when it became necessary.

## QoL Changes
- Fast text and stereo sound are now the default options.
- Pokemon learnsets have been given a large upheaval, now being easier to use. A conservative approach was employed to ensure the GSC feel was preserved. Move additions have been made based on prototype and future game material (eg. Sing Pidgeot using proto-RG), but odd ones (eg. Aeroblast Skarmory) were omitted.
- A Trader NPC is available in a new Lake of Rage town area, allowing you to access trade evolutions natively.
- DVs, Stat Exp., and Hidden Power now display on the stat screen.
- Kurt now makes Apricorn Balls instantly. He's had his coffee and is listening to his favourite music.
- Instant text is now an option!
- Clock reset procedure is now like vanilla GS, requiring just Down + B.
- Gen 6 Experience System!
- Poke Balls now all have unique palettes.
- The high friendship evolution threshold is now 170, making Friend Balls sufficient for instant evolution. Hatching Pokemon from eggs also makes friendship-based evolution take minimal effort.
- Items previously only obtainable via the Time Capsule are now distributed to specific Pokemon (5%: Polkadot Bow Snubbull, TwistedSpoon Kadabra, Metal Powder Ditto/Mimmeo, Light Ball Pikachu; 50%: Lucky Punch Chansey)
- During the intro, when knowing the PokeGear instructions, you can now skip some of the text relating to it, making starting the game slightly less agonising.
- Present Glitch was returned in full, now always having the funny damage calculations the move is known for in GSC.

## Map Changes
Numerous new maps are available, featuring new locations, the iconic Sevii Islands, and the Nihon region!

Additionally, there have been many wild encounter tweaks. View this document for details. (will link when hack is in a playable state)

- The Nihon region now exists! A victory lap after conquering Kanto and Johto, expect some serious challenge and spirited reconstruction of the iconic proto-Region!
- The Sevii Islands have been appended to Kanto, complete with a new and unique quest, reconstructions of cut routes, and more! 
- Johto wild encounters have been changed to be more weighted towards Johto Pokemon; eg. Murkrow is available about Ecruteak at night, Misdreavus largely replaces Gastly, etc. Levels have been adjusted.
- Kanto wild encounters have generally higher levels to aid in improving the level curve. Likewise, it's weighted towards Kanto Pokemon.
- Numerous new NPC sprites from prototype materials, RBY, and more, are restored and distributed throughout the regions, hoping for a more colourful feel.
- Rock Smash now has variable and higher-quality wild data, featuring rare, location-based Pokemon (eg. Corsola on the shore), and level adjustments to make them more appropriate.
- Pokemon Centres are now dynamic across all three main regions, possessing themed floorings and map design.
- HGSS locations have been appended to Johto, making it slightly bigger.
- The Sinjoh Ruins exists, being built for obtaining Hisuian Pokemon. Try catching all the Unown!
- The Pokemon Communications Centre from JP GSC has been added and tweaked into a Regional Variant Trade hub, increasing with badge count.
	- The GS Ball event has been restored, now being obtainable after beating the Elite Four and trying to exit the building.
	- The Egg Ticket and Eon Mail events have been restored, now being associated with Buena's Password. Redeeming the Egg Ticket gives you an Odd Egg with the usual Pokemon pool and Shiny chances; this is soft resettable if you like that sort of thing.
	- The News Machine now simply references events from the old competitive scene, similar to what was done at the time. Considerations are being made for progression-based bits and pieces.
	- Additionally, old lore relating to the area has now been restored, including something about the Unown!
- The Bug Catching Contest now gives slightly more rewards, including a familiar Gligar...
- Mania & Shuckie now have a reworked reward system, giving the player a special item...
- The prototype Lake of Rage village has been restored, complete with an Evolution Stone shop and Trader NPC! In general, it's themed around Pokemon evolution.
- The Haunted House from proto-GSC has been added south of Blackthorn City!
- Viridian Forest has been restored.
- The Pewter Museum of Science has been restored.
- Like the spooky Lavender Town? Experience a new location filled with spooks and haunts!
- The Kanto Safari Zone map from the prototype has been restored.
- The Summer Beach House has been added south of Fuchsia City, now being a Surf tutor for Pikachu!
- Cerulean Cave has been restored, complete with a Mewtwo fight!
- Walls can be climbed using Strong Arm, functionality identical to HGSS Rock Climb.
- Deep water now exists for Dive, with various locations across Johto, Kanto, and Nihon featuring it.

The name literally translates to "Kingly serpent" or "Lordly serpent", where "Ajaw" was the name for a king or ruler, and "can" is the spelling for "serpent" used in Kukulcan, the deity worshipped by Mayans of the day.

# 16-bit index expansion for Crystal

This repository contains a modified Pokémon Crystal game, updated to handle 16-bit indexes. The main goal of this
project is to create a reusable system that ROM hacks can use to bring 16-bit indexes into their games.  
It is *not* within scope to create a new game, or to add additional features beyond 16-bit indexes.

The `master` branch of this repository is intended to perform identically to the original Pokémon Crystal, with
minimal changes to support further development on it. Other branches will implement more features on top of it; the
intention is that the necessary changes can be readily seen by comparing said branches to `master` (or between each
other). Therefore, these other branches will never be merged into `master`, even though they will always be directly
descended from it (i.e., in Git terminology, a merge would be a fast-forward).

Since this repository is intended to be used as a reference, the commit history is intentionally kept clean to make
changes clearly visible. Therefore, modifications (such as bug fixes) will often be merged into whichever commit is
more suitable for them, with the remainder of the commit tree rebased on top of the updated commit. **Please do not
fork this repository to build a new game on top** (unless you intend to contribute to it), as the publicly-visible
history will be repeatedly rewritten, making merges impossible. If you do want to contribute to the repository, let
me know in advance so I can notify you of history rewrites.

For further documentation, check out the [wiki].

## Branches

* `master`: (status: **stable**, last update: **2023-07-18**) Base branch. This branch contains a slightly modified
  version of Pokémon Crystal, with some quality-of-life improvements intended to make development easier. These
  improvements have been taken from the documentation in the [main disassembly repository][pokecrystal]. This branch
  contains no 16-bit features and it is only intended as a reference.
* `base-components`: (status: **stable**, last update: **2023-07-18**) This branch defines the basic components that
  will comprise the 16-bit index table system, on top of which the remaining branches will be built. Since it only
  defines macros (and a handful of WRAM locations to be shared by all index tables), it should build the same ROM as
  `master`.
* `expand-mon-ID`: (status: **stable**, last update: **2023-07-18**) This branch implements 16-bit indexes for Pokémon
  species, thus allowing more than 253 species to be included in a single game.
* `expand-move-ID`: (status: **stable**, last update: **2023-07-18**) This branch implements 16-bit indexes for moves,
  on top of the existing 16-bit support for Pokémon species from the previous branch. (Interaction between the
  branches is kept to a minimum, though.)
* `newbox`: (status: **experimental**, last update: **2023-07-18**) This branch ports Rangi & FIQ's "newbox" from
  Polished Crystal. Newbox is a complete overhaul to Bill's PC, and this branch ports the functionality on
  top of the previous branches.
* `pokecrystal`: (status: **N/A**, last update **2023-07-18**) This branch contains pret's vanilla pokecrystal and
  should only be used to compare with the previous branches to view pokecrystal16 changes. **DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH!**

To view the differences between any two branches (or any two commits in the repository), you can use GitHub's [tree
comparison][compare] tool.

## FAQs

**Q1:** Will this engine include \<insert additional feature here\>?  
**A1:** Unless the feature is specifically related to 16-bit indexing (or otherwise extending the range of possible
index values), the answer is almost certainly "no". This repository's scope is limited to 16-bit indexes. If you
already have a ROM hack that includes the features you like and you'd want it to have 16-bit indexes, the right course
of action would be to port this engine to it. Otherwise, you can use this engine as a base to make your own ROM hack
with all the features you want.

**Q2:** Can I use this engine for my own ROM hack?  
**A2:** Of course; that's what it was made for. I will try make it as easy as possible to port to existing or new ROM
hacks; instructions to do so will be in the [wiki]. All I can ask you for is that, just like this engine was openly
available for you to use, you make your hack's code openly available as well — quoting some of the text in
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org)'s copyright disclaimer, "may you share freely, never taking more than you give".

**Q3:** What's this engine's new limit on indexes?  
**A3:** The theoretical limit is 65,534, minus a couple of "special" indexes used by the game for specific purposes
(such as the value that indicates that a Pokémon is inside an egg). However, there are several limitations that will
probably prevent you from ever reaching that limit. For starters, you can't fit 65,534 of _anything_ inside a ROM
bank! The index work is done, and I'll try to remove any hurdles that would render that work useless; however, if you
want to push the limits of the hardware and add 20,000 new Pokémon, you'll find yourself against a technical challenge
that will go beyond indexes.
