; Because there's no player here, we're taking the opportunity to expand on Cal.
; In base GSC, he's a trainer who travels to Viridian City to challenge the player, acting as a stand-in if you haven't used Mystery Gift before.
; In Stadium 2, he is given a unique design and uses largely random Pokemon.
; Everything just kind of falls into place, no?

; So here, we're having Cal be a trainer who enjoys using rental Pokemon. He loves to battle, but doesn't want to spend too much time training or catching his own. He gets more excitement out of quick-thinking and wit!

; He'll still have his Trainer House role, but we're changing that up a bit too!
